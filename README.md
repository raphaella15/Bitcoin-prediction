This project aims to predict winning patterns in Bitcoin trading using machine learning algorithms. 
The goal is to develop models that can forecast potential winning opportunities for traders,
helping them make informed decisions in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to leverage historical Bitcoin price data,
along with relevant market indicators and sentiment analysis, to build predictive models. 
These models will analyze past trends and patterns to identify signals that indicate a high probability of Bitcoin price increases, 
thus signaling potential winning opportunities.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical Bitcoin price data,
including open, high, low, and close prices, as well as trading volume and market sentiment indicators. 
This data is collected from various cryptocurrency exchanges and sources, 
covering a significant time span to capture diverse market conditions.
